This is the original Vault Hunters mod, but the internal commands used in the original series have been added back in.

The commands are -

    /the_vault internal received_sub_gift actor Amount Tier
    
    /the_vault internal received_bit_donation actor Amount
    
    /the_vault internal received_donation actor Amount
    
    /the_vault internal raffle actor

The final missing command is received_sub which currently can't be implemented as the Arena source code is not available in the public release.
