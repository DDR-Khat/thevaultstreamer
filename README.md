This is the original Vault Hunters mod, but the internal commands used in the original series have been added back in.

The commands are -
    /the_vault internal received_sub_gift <String actor> <Integer Amount> <Integer 0-3 Tier>
    /the_vault internal received_bit_donation <String actor> <Integer Amount>
    /the_vault internal received_donation <String actor> <Integer Amount>
    /the_vault internal raffle <String actor>

The final missing command is received_sub which currently can't be implemented as the Arena source code is not available in the public release.
