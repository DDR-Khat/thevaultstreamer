This is the original Vault Hunters mod, but the internal commands used in the original series have been added back in.

The commands are -

    /the_vault internal received_sub_gift actor Amount Tier
    
    /the_vault internal received_bit_donation actor Amount
    
    /the_vault internal received_donation actor Amount
    
    /the_vault internal received_sub actor
    
New commands are -

    /the_vault internal raffle actor *
    
    /the_vault raider
    

*Received sub only adds sub fighters to the vault - no arena code has been added.
